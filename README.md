*Project Overview

This project is a modern frontend web application created using **Vite**, a lightning-fast build tool, in combination with **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and **TypeScript** for robust, type-safe JavaScript development. It is structured for scalability and performance, making it an ideal foundation for responsive and maintainable web apps. The source files are organized in a `project` directory, containing all necessary configuration and code files to run, build, and deploy the application.

 Project Structure

The main directory includes several important files and folders that drive the development environment. The `index.html` file acts as the primary entry point for the application in the browser. Configuration files like `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts` define the build and development behavior, while `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` control the styling process. TypeScript settings are managed through various `tsconfig` files such as `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, and `tsconfig.node.json`. The `package.json` file handles metadata about the project, its dependencies, and essential scripts. The `node_modules` directory contains installed packages and libraries.

 Getting Started

To get started with this project, you must have **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) installed on your machine, which typically comes bundled with **npm**, the Node package manager. Once Node.js is installed, open your terminal and navigate to the project directory by running `cd project`. Then, install all required dependencies by executing `npm install`. After installation, you can launch the development environment with `npm run dev`. This will start a local development server where changes are reflected in real-time. For production deployment, you can generate an optimized build by using the command `npm run build`. If you'd like to test the production build locally, use the `npm run preview` command.
Technologies Used

This application uses several modern web technologies. **Vite** provides a fast and efficient development server with hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized build outputs. **Tailwind CSS** allows you to style components directly in your markup using utility classes, significantly speeding up the design workflow. **TypeScript** adds optional static typing to JavaScript, enabling developers to catch bugs early and write cleaner, more maintainable code. Together, these technologies form a powerful toolchain for modern frontend development.

# ðŸ“Œ Key Features

The project is designed for ease of use and extensibility. With minimal setup, you get a working development environment that supports live reloading, modular component architecture, and seamless TypeScript integration. The structure is ideal for beginners learning modern frontend stacks as well as professionals aiming to build production-ready applications.
